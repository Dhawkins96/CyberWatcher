# CyberWatcher

## Welcome to Cyber Watcher

Cyber Watcher is for those who work from home, either due to the on-going pandemic, self-employed; or those who just want to monitor their local network.
The main idea for the Cyber Watcher project came after the first lockdown, due to COVID, in March of 2020. Coming from an office-based career, almost all of my previous work colleagues were now forced to work from home, using their own devices and local network. Then the thought occurred, how do they truly know they are safe, especially those who deal with handling customer/clients’ personal information. They all know about The Data Protection Act (2018) and making sure that keeping the sensitive information safe and secure was one of the most important parts of their jobs. They can keep the paper files secure in a locked draw/cabinet but what if their home network is compromised? They might not have the technical knowledge to know where to look in their systems.

This is where a system like Cyber Watcher would help both the employee, company, and their customers. Cyber Watcher is a Security Dashboard for home users which provides them with an overview of their network showing any/all devices connected. Cyber Watcher has a built-in password manager for the user to also store all their passwords and it also has a password generator to create secure passwords when needed. The final feature of Cyber Watcher is it has a help/advice page which can provide the user with more advice on how they can protect themselves. Informing the user not only on what they are seeing within the application with regards to the network information but will also show them how they can be more aware of their own cyber security in the future, protecting them and their work.

Cyber Watcher is a WPF desktop application with a SQL database for storing the users’ information. Monitoring their home network by using a preprogramed NMAP scan and outputting the finding in an easy-to-understand way. By using Cyber Watcher, the user will get an overview of their whole system. Providing a sense of ease in these stressful times.
